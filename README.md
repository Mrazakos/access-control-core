# Access Control Core

A TypeScript proof of concept for a decentralized Access Control System with Zero-Knowledge Proof verification. This implementation demonstrates the core concepts of a blockchain-based access control system with verifiable credentials (VCs), smart locks, and secure lock management.

## Architecture

The system implements a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) architecture where smart locks verify VCs without ever seeing the original user data, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

### Core Flow

1. **Lock Owner** calls Smart Contract's `createLock()` → gets unique lockId
2. **Lock Owner** configures physical Smart Lock with lockId and public key
3. **Lock Owner** issues Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to authorized users (referred to as VCs after first mention)
4. **User** sends VC to Smart Lock for access
5. **Smart Lock** verifies VC using only data hashes (zero-knowledge verification)

### Core Classes

- **User**: Manages VCs with 1-VC-per-lock constraint
- **Lock**: Smart lock controller that verifies VCs using ZKP principles
- **LockOwner**: Lock owners who issue VCs and manage VC lifecycle
- **SmartContract**: Singleton managing global lock state and ownership validation
- **CryptoUtils**: RSA-2048 cryptographic operations with object signing support

### Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Smart locks verify VCs without accessing original user data
- **1-VC-per-Lock Constraint**: Each user can only have one active VC per lock
- **Owner-Only Revocation**: Only lock owners can revoke VCs (signatures). Locks themselves cannot be revoked.
- **Hash-Based Signatures**: VCs contain signed hashes of user metadata for privacy
- **Active Lock Validation**: Automatic checking of VC status during verification
- **RSA-2048 Encryption**: Production-ready cryptographic implementation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Running the Demo

To see the complete ZKP access control flow in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or to run the compiled version:
```bash
npm start
```

The demo showcases:
- Lock owner registering a new lock via smart contract
- Physical smart lock configuration with lock credentials
- Issuing VCs with hash-based signatures
- Zero-knowledge proof verification (smart lock never sees original user data)
- VC revocation and security validation

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

The comprehensive test suite covers:
- Lock registration and management with proper ownership
- Zero-knowledge proof VC verification
- 1-VC-per-lock constraint enforcement on the user side
- Owner-only VC revocation security
- Active VC validation during verification
- RSA cryptographic operations

### Stress Testing

For comprehensive cryptographic validation, run the stress tests:

```bash
# Quick stress test (5,000 iterations)
npm run test:stress
or
node run-stress-test.js

# Comprehensive multi-scenario stress testing
npm run stress-test
```

The stress testing validates:
- **PKCS1_PSS_PADDING robustness** under high load
- **Encoding/decoding integrity** across thousands of operations
- **Edge case handling** (Unicode, large data, special characters)
- **Performance metrics** for production readiness assessment

Results are automatically saved for thesis documentation in JSON and Markdown formats.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { LockOwner, User, Lock, SmartContract } from './src/index';

// Create a lock owner
const lockOwner = new LockOwner();

// Register a new lock through smart contract (gets unique lockId)
const lock = lockOwner.registerNewLock("Front Door Lock");

// Issue a verifiable credential (VC) with zero-knowledge proof
const user = new User();
const userMetadata = {
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "John Doe",
  timeStamp: new Date(),
};
const vc = lockOwner.issueVc(lock.lockId, userMetadata, 'Front Door Access');

// User stores the VC (enforces 1-VC-per-lock)
user.storeVc(vc);

// Smart lock verifies using ZKP - only sees the hash, not original data
const smartLock = new Lock(lock.lockId, lock.publicKey);
const isValidVC = smartLock.verifyVc(vc);

console.log('ZKP Verification Result:', isValidVC);

// Owner can revoke VC (only owner can revoke VCs, locks cannot be revoked)
lockOwner.revokeAccessWithVc(lock.lockId, vc.signature);

// Verification now fails for revoked VC
const isStillValid = smartLock.verifyVc(vc);
console.log('After revocation:', isStillValid); // false
```

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

The system implements ZKP principles where:

1. **User metadata is hashed** before being signed
2. **Smart locks only receive the hash** in the VC
3. **Original user data never leaves the issuer** (Lock Owner)
4. **Verification uses only the hash** and signature validation
5. **Privacy is maintained** while ensuring security

### VC Structure

```typescript
interface VerifiableCredential {
  lockId: number;
  userMetaDataHash: string;  // SHA-256 hash of user data (ZKP)
  lockNickname: string;
  signature: string;         // RSA signature of the hash
}
```
